# Bandura-Coding-Test

Main.py should be fairly self-contained. It uses a database called "network.db" and a table called "addresses" to store inputs. It creates the table if the table is not already available. 

Coded with the most recent versions of Python and PyCharm.

Let me know if any functionality needs to be added.
